Contributing to the Plugin
==========================

Plugin source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin).
New feature proposals and bug fix proposals should be submitted as
[GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
Fork the repository on GitHub, prepare your change on your forked
copy, and submit a pull request (see [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/pulls) for open pull requests). Your pull request will be evaluated by the [Cloudbees Jenkins job](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/plugins/job/jira-plugin/)
and you should receive e-mail with the results of the evaluation.

If you are adding new features please make sure that they support Jenkins Workflow Plugin.
See (here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md) for some information.

Before submitting your change make sure that:
* you added tests - the coverage will be checked after submitting PRs
* the code formatting follows the plugin standard (i.e. how most of the source code is formatted)
* imports are organised
* you use findbugs to see if you haven't introduced any new warnings.

There have been many developers involved
in the git plugin and there are many, many users who depend on the
git-plugin.  Tests help us assure that we're delivering a reliable
plugin, and that we've communicated our intent to other developers in
a way that they can detect when they run tests.
